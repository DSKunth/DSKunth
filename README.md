### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- My career interests revolve around connecting Finance and IT. 
- I worked previously as an accountant and as an Oracle business analyst.
- Currently on a career break to upskill. 
- As part of my efforts to upskill and gain a deeper understanding of the sophisticated techniques surrounding data, I teach myself the convergence of AI, digital innovation, cloud computing, and data analytics and engineering through a virtual learning program and online data courses.
- Tools: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL (PostgreSQL, Google BigQuery, MYSQL, Cassandra), BI (Power Bi, Tableau)
