Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Greetings! I am Dorothy, and here is my brief bio:
- I am exploring opportunities in Data Analytics while reskilling and upskilling in the field of data science. 
- Meanwhile, I am completing a [Google Data Analytics Professional certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) sponsored by [INCO Academy](https://incoacademy.de/en/programs/67) and Google.org.
